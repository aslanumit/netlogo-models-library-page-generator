<h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This model illustrates how to integrate machine learning with agent-based modeling. The model creates a set of turtles whose goal is to get to the upper right corner of the world. The turtles start with random strategies, but the model then uses an evolutionary approach they improve their strategies over time to reach this corner.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>The model initially creates 20 agents and a list of inputs, such as <code>HEADING</code> and <code>XCOR</code>, and operators, such as <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, etc. It then sets the strategy for each of the agents to a random set of five input / operator combinations. Each strategy results in the turtle changing its heading. When the model runs, each agent executes their strategy twenty five times, moves forward 1 after execution of its strategy, and measures its fitness. On the basis of this measurement, the worst 75% of the turtles in terms of performance are killed and replaced by mutated copies of the top performing 25%. This process is then repeated.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Press SETUP to create the agents and strategies.</p>
<p>Press GO to run the agent strategies and see their evolution over time time.</p>
<p>The BEST FITNESS monitor shows the maximum fitness for agents in the current generation. Fitness is defined here as the distance between the turtle and its goal, expressed as a negative value: the closer this value is to zero, the closer the turtle is to the goal, and thus, the more "fit" it is.</p>
<p>The AVERAGE FITNESS VS. TIME plot shows the evolution of the average fitness of the whole population, which should increase over time.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>Do all the agents do the same thing? Can you tell the difference between the different strategies? Do you understand how inputs and operators combine to produce a heading for the turtle?</p>
<p>Do the best turtles reach their goal? Do they reach it <em>exactly</em>? If they don't succeed in achieving a distance of zero, why do you think that is? Is there any modification that you could make to the model to allow such a result to be achieved?</p>
<p>Do the strategies seem to converge over time? You should notice that, even when they do, there is still some variation in the population because mutations are introduced with each new generation.</p>
<p>Finally, have you noticed that not every run of the model produces the same "best fitness". Sometimes, the population gets stuck in what we call a "local maximum". This happens when the best turtles in the population have sub-optimal fitness, but every single mutation their offsprings can have actually makes them worse. To reach the "global maximum", they would need many successive mutations, but the current model does not allow that: turtles that are worse then their parent get eliminated right away.</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>Change the list of inputs and operators and see how that affects the results of the model. Can you find a combination of inputs and operators that allow the turtles to reach their goal exactly?</p>
<p>Think about the "local maximum" problem mentioned in the previous section. Can you think of a way out of it? In the current model, only the best 25% of turtles get to reproduce, but maybe this does not have to be the case. Do you think it could be helpful to give other turtles a small chance to reproduce as well?</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>This model uses the NetLogo's <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#runresult"><code>runresult</code></a> primitive, which allows you to execute a piece code stored in a string and report its result.</p>
<p>Our strategies are not directly stored as strings, however: they are stored as <em>lists</em> of strings. To turn a strategy into a single string that can be handled by <code>runresult</code>, we use the <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#reduce"><code>reduce</code></a> primitive, which can turn a list of values into a single value by repeatedly applying a reporter to combine elements of the list. In this case, the reporter used is <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#word"><code>word</code></a>, which simply concatenates the strings.</p>
<p>The <code>runresult</code> primitive can also be used with <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/programming.html#tasks">tasks</a> instead of strings. See the Sandpile model in the library for an example.</p>
