<p>This model is from Chapter Four of the book "Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling: Modeling Natural, Social and Engineered Complex Systems with NetLogo", by Uri Wilensky &amp; William Rand.</p>

<p>This model is in the IABM Textbook folder of the NetLogo Models Library. The model, as well as any updates to the model, can also be found on the textbook website: http://www.intro-to-abm.com/.</p>
<h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This is the fourth model in a set of five models that build towards a predator prey model of population dynamics.  This fourth model gives the sheep the ability to reproduce.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>The model creates a population of sheep that wander around the landscape. Moving around costs some energy, and when their energy gets too low, sheep die. However, the sheep can eat grass in the environment to regain energy and the grass regrows over time.  If the energy of a sheep gets above a certain level, it can reproduce.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Set the NUMBER-OF-SHEEP slider and press SETUP to create the initial population. You can also change the MOVEMENT-COST slider to affect the energy cost of movement for the sheep. The GRASS-REGROWTH-RATE slider affects how fast the grass grows back, while the ENERGY-GAIN-FROM-GRASS slider affects how much energy the sheep can gain from eating the grass.</p>
<p>After this, press the GO button to make the sheep move around the landscape, and eat the grass.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>Is there any relationship between where the sheep die off and where they reproduce?</p>
<p>Do all the sheep reproduce at the same time? Why is that?</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>How does reproduction affect the model results?  Is it easier to get the sheep to continue to live?  For instance, do the values of GRASS-REGROWTH-RATE, MOVEMENT-COST and ENERGY-GAIN-FROM-GRASS necessary to balance the sheep population change when the sheep reproduce?</p>
