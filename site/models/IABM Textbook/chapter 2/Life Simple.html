<h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This program is a simple example of the Life model, which is a 2D cellular automaton.</p>
<p>A cellular automaton is a computational machine that performs actions based on certain rules.  It can be thought of as a board which is divided into cells (such as square cells of a checkerboard).  Each cell can be either "alive" or "dead."  This is called the "state" of the cell.  According to specified rules, each cell will be alive or dead at the next time step.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>The rules of the game are as follows.  Each cell checks the state of itself and its eight surrounding neighbors and then sets itself to either alive or dead.  If there are less than two alive neighbors, then the cell dies.  If there are more than three alive neighbors, the cell dies.  If there are 2 alive neighbors, the cell remains in the state it is in.  If there are exactly three alive neighbors, the cell becomes alive. This is done in parallel and continues forever.</p>
<p>There are certain recurring shapes in Life, for example, the "glider" and the "blinker". The glider is composed of 5 cells which form a small arrow-headed shape, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">   O
    O
  OOO
</code></pre>
<p>This glider will wiggle across the world, retaining its shape.  A blinker is a block of three cells (either up and down or left and right) that rotates between horizontal and vertical orientations.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Press SETUP to seed the model with a random set of "living" and "dead" cells.  Press GO-ONCE to iterate the model one step, or press GO to let the model run for awhile.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>Can you identify the different structures, described in the textbook?  Specifically, can you find a "block", "oscillator", and "spaceship" or "glider"?</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>Inspect some patches so that you can see the rules play out tick by tick.</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>Modify the code so that there are more alive cells at the start of the run.</p>
<p>Experiment with using neighbors4 instead of neighbors (see below).</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>The neighbors primitive returns the agentset of the patches to the north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.  So <code>count neighbors with [living?]</code> counts how many of those eight patches have the <code>living?</code> patch variable set to true.</p>
<p><code>neighbors4</code> is like <code>neighbors</code> but only uses the patches to the north, south, east, and west.  Some cellular automata, like this one, are defined using the 8-neighbors rule, others the 4-neighbors.</p>
