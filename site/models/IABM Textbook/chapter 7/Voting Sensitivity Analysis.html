<p>This model is from Chapter Seven of the book "Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling: Modeling Natural, Social and Engineered Complex Systems with NetLogo", by Uri Wilensky &amp; William Rand.</p>

<p>This model is in the IABM Textbook folder of the NetLogo Models Library. The model, as well as any updates to the model, can also be found on the textbook website: http://www.intro-to-abm.com/.</p>
<h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This model is a simple cellular automaton that simulates voting distribution by having each patch take a "vote" of its eight surrounding neighbors, then perhaps change its own vote according to the outcome. The sensitivity version of this model alters the original model by allowing the user to specify the initial percentage of the green patches in the model and to test whether the model's behavior is sensitive to the initial percentages of the colors.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Click the SETUP button to create an approximately equal but random distribution of blue and green patches.  Click GO to run the simulation.</p>
<p>When both switches are off, the central patch changes its color to match the majority vote, but if there is a 4-4 tie, then it does not change.</p>
<p>If the CHANGE-VOTE-IF-TIED? switch is on, then in the case of a tie, the central patch will always change its vote.</p>
<p>If the AWARD-CLOSE-CALLS-TO-LOSER? switch is on, then if the result is 5-3, the central patch votes with the losing side instead of the winning side.</p>
<p>The INITIAL-GREEN-PCT slider controls the percentage of initial green patches.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>How does the INITIAL-GREEN-PCT affect the results of the model?</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>Run the sensitivity-experiment in BehaviorSpace and graph the results using your favorite statistical analysis package.</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>The model currently has two monitors that show the number of green and blue patches. It would be nice to add a plot that shows the relationship between these two numbers. It could be a line plot showing the percentage of green patches, or it could be a histogram showing the count for each color. Why don't you try both and see which one you like best?</p>
<h2>RELATED MODELS</h2>
<p>This is a slight variant of the Voting model in the Social Sciences section of the NetLogo models library.</p>
<p>It is a companion model to another model from Chapter seven of the Textbook, Voting Component Verification.</p>
<p>Another related model is Ising in the Chemistry and Physics section of the NetLogo models library. Although it's a physics model, the rules are very similar.</p>
