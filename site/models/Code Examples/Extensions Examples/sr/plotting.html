        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>A demo illustrating how to use the SimpleR extension and how to use it to make plots.</p>
<p>The model is based off of the "Simple Economy" model from the default models library. The only additions made are those related to the SimpleR extension.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>In the create-r-plot procedure, the SimpleR extension is setup, wealth values of the turtles are sent over from the NetLogo process to the R environment and a plot is constructed.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Run setup and use "go" to run the model for a bit. Stop the model and then specify a filename for the output image file. The resulting file will be a .png regardless of the filename specified. Hit "create R plot image" and the resulting plot image should appear in the same directory as the .nlogo file.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>Notice how NetLogo values are passed to the extension with sr:set.</p>
<p>Additionally, notice how we need to convert the NetLogo <em>list</em> to an R numeric vector in order to create a histogram with it.</p>
<p>Finally, see that we can pass repeating string parameters to sr:run in order to easily supply multiple lines of R code.</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>Try performing more data analysis on the wealth data within the R code.</p>
