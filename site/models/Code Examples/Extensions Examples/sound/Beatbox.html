        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This is a drum machine made with NetLogo.  It uses the sound extension.  You can make your own beats with it.  Beats can be saved to disk and then loaded back in later.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>Colored squares represent drum hits.  The world is a "map" of the composition in which time moves from left to right.  Each row of patches is a particular drum, and each column represents a moment in time.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>To make a beat, first press the GO button to start the drum machine running.  Then click the mouse in the view to add and remove drum hits.</p>
<p>You can adjust the speed of the music with the BPM (beats per minute) slider, and the volume using the VELOCITY slider.  You can think of velocity as how fast the drumstick hits the drum.  A faster hit makes a louder sound.  The term "velocity" is standard in MIDI.  (MIDI is the underlying music technology that NetLogo's sound extension uses.)</p>
<p>To silence an individual drum, click the white square to the left of the drum's name.  To bring it back, click the same square again.  This lets you experiment with the effect of adding or removing different drums from your beat.</p>
