        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This is an example of how to use LevelSpace to run many models concurrently.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>This example allows a user to open up any number of GUI models as LevelSpace 'child' models. LevelSpace can then be used to run these models concurrently.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>The SETUP button calls <code>ls:reset</code> which causes all loaded models to be unloaded.</p>
<p>By pressing the OPEN A MODEL button, users can load any number of GUI models in LevelSpace. Click the button once for each model and select the model you'd like to load.</p>
<p>Use the SETUP-MODELS button to ask each model loaded via LevelSpace to call their setup procedure.</p>
<p>The GO button will ask each model loaded via LevelSpace to call their go procedure.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY: Extending the Model</h2>
<p>This model provides a flexible template for opening up many different models, but they do not interact in any way. Think of ways that they could interact using the <code>ls</code> primitives, and put that in this model's GO procedure.</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>This model uses LevelSpace, an extension that comes bundled with NetLogo 6.0+.</p>
<h2>RELATED MODELS</h2>
<p>See the Model Visualizer and Plotter Example and the Model Interactions Example.</p>
