        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>The turtle goes forward "distance-of-travel" and returns to (start-x, start-y). The green patch is the center patch upon which there is a turtle at (start-x, start-y), and the patch "distance-of-travel" away from that center will flash as the turtle passes through it.</p>
<p>This is an illustration of the difference between a radius of 1 and the distance from patch to patch. Distance in NetLogo is measured in patches, and so "forward 1" for a turtle means for it to go forward exactly the length of one side of a patch. However, as illustrated by the pythagorean theorem, the distance across the diagonal of a patch is root 2 (around 1.414). As such, there are points and headings of a turtle within a patch from which going forward 1 will <em>not</em> result in changing the patch on which the turtle lands.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>There is a searcher turtle that travels clockwise at distance-of-travel from the center (start-x,start-y). The searcher returns to the center each tick and goes forward distance-of-travel. distance-of-travel, start-x, and start-y are all sliders. The center turtle simply marks the center at (start-x, start-y).</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Press setup, then press go. You can change the sliders while the model is running.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>Patches are laid out in NetLogo such that they span from pxcor - 0.5 on the left to an open boundary at pxcor + 0.5. The same equation is used for pycor. That is, for patch 3 1, it's actual real range is ([-3.5,2.5), [-1.5,-0.5)). This is illustrated in the model.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>Try changing start-x to 0.5 and start-y to 0.5. Where is the green patch now? Now try changing start-x to -0.5 and start-y to -0.5. When the start-x = -0.5 and start-y = -0.5, the turtle is centered on patch 0 0. When the start-x = 0.5 and start-y = 0.5, the turtle is centered on patch 1 1.</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>You could change the model such that there are a "halo" of turtles always distance-of-travel from the center.</p>
