        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This example shows how to construct a regular lattice or mesh of links.  Two kinds of lattice are demonstrated, a square lattice (where each node has four neighbors) and a hex lattice (where each node has six neighbors).</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>The current code creates undirected links.  To modify <code>setup-square</code> to create a fully connected lattice of directed links, use <code>create-links-to</code> instead of <code>create-links-with</code>.  (Making the same change to the hex lattice code is only a little trickier.)</p>
<p>If you turn off wrapping at one or both world boundaries, the lattice will be bounded.  You don't need to change the square lattice code in that case, because the <code>neighbors4</code> primitive returns fewer than four neighbors for patches on the world edges. (Making the same change to the hex lattice code is only a little trickier.)</p>
<p>The square lattice can be modified to include diagonal links by changing <code>neighbors4</code> to <code>neighbors</code>.</p>
