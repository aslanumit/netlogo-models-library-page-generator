        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This code example shows how to use the basic neighborhood primitives.  These include <code>neighbors</code>, <code>neighbors4</code>, <code>in-radius</code>, and <code>at-points</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>neighbors</code>: reports the patches surrounding a patch or turtle both patches that share a side and those that share a corner. If the world is a torus every patch will have eight neighbors, if wrapping is not allowed in either direction the edge patches will have fewer neighbors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>neighbors4</code>: reports the same patches, excluding the ones at the corners.  On a torus there will always be four neighbors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>&lt;agentset&gt; in-radius &lt;number&gt;</code>: reports those agents in agentset whose distance from the caller is less than or equal to n.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>&lt;agentset&gt; at-points &lt;list&gt;</code>: reports those agents in agentset at the given points relative to the caller, where <code>list</code> is a list of two-number lists.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although in this example, we only change the color of the reported patches, you can of course do more complicated operations, including assigning that agentset to a variable. This is particularly useful in cellular automata models.</p>
