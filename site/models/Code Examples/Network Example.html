        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This example demonstrates how to make a network in NetLogo.  The network consists of a collection of nodes, some of which are connected by links.</p>
<p>This example doesn't do anything in particular with the nodes and links.  You can use it as the basis for your own model that actually does something with them.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>In this particular example, the links are undirected.  NetLogo supports directed links too, though.</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>Try making it so you can drag the nodes around using the mouse.</p>
<p>Use the turtle variable <code>label</code> to label the nodes and/or links with some information.</p>
<p>Try calculating some statistics about the network that forms, for example the average degree.</p>
<p>Try other rules for connecting nodes besides totally randomly.  For example, you could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect every node to every other node.</li>
<li>Make sure each node has at least one link going in or out.</li>
<li>Only connect nodes that are spatially close to each other.</li>
<li>Make some nodes into "hubs" (with lots of links).</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Make two kinds of nodes, differentiated by color, then only allow links to connect two nodes that are different colors.  This makes the network "bipartite."  (You might position the two kinds of nodes in two straight lines.)</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>Nodes and edges are both agents.  Nodes are turtles, edges are links.</p>
