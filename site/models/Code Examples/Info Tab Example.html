        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This model shows you how to use the Info tab.</p>
<p>You edit the Info tab as unformatted plain text.  When you're done editing, the plain text you entered is displayed in a more attractive format.</p>
<p>To control how the formatted display looks, you use a "markup language" called Markdown. You may have encountered Markdown elsewhere; it is used on a number of web sites.  (There are other markup languages in use on the web; for example, Wikipedia used a markup language called MediaWiki.  Different markup languages differ in their details.)</p>
<p>The remainder of this document shows how to use Markdown.</p>
<h2>Headings</h2>
<p>A heading begins with one or more hash marks (<code>#</code>). The number of hash marks used controls the size and prominence of the header, with one hash mark indicating the largest header.</p>
<h4>Input</h4>
<pre><code class="language-text"># First-level heading

## Second-level heading

### Third-level heading

#### Fourth-level heading
</code></pre>
<h2>Paragraphs</h2>
<h4>Example</h4>
<pre><code class="language-text">This is a paragraph. There are no spaces before the word 'This'.

This is another paragraph. The first line has two sentences.
The entire paragraph has one line with three sentences.

Single line breaks in the input
do not make line breaks in the output,
as demonstrated here.

<h2>Italicized and bold text</h2>
<h4>Example</h4>
<pre><code class="language-text">For italics, surround text with underscores:
_hello, world_.

For bold, surround text with two asterisks:
**hello, world**.

You can also combine them:
_**hello**_ and **_goodbye_**
</code></pre>
<h4>Formatted</h4>
<p>For italics, surround text with underscores:
<em>hello, world</em>.</p>
<p>For bold, surround text with two asterisks:
<strong>hello, world</strong>.</p>
<p>You can also combine them:
<em><strong>hello</strong></em> and <strong><em>goodbye</em></strong></p>
<h2>Ordered lists</h2>
<h4>Example</h4>
<pre><code class="language-text">We are about to start an ordered list.

  1. Ordered lists are indented 2 spaces.
    a) Subitems are indented 2 more spaces (4 in all).
  2. The next item in the list starts with the next number.
  3. And so on...
</code></pre>
<h4>Formatted</h4>
<p>We are about to start an ordered list.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ordered lists are indented 2 spaces.
    a) Subitems are indented 2 more spaces (4 in all for a second level item).</li>
<li>The next item in the list starts with the next number.</li>
<li>And so on...</li>
</ol>
<h2>Unordered lists</h2>
<h4>Example</h4>
<pre><code class="language-text">We are about to start an unordered list.

  * Like ordered lists, unordered lists are also indented 2 spaces.
  * Unlike ordered lists, unordered lists use stars instead of numbers.
    * Sub items are indented 2 more spaces.
    * Here's another sub item.
</code></pre>
<h4>Formatted</h4>
<p>We are about to start an unordered list.</p>
<ul>
<li>Like ordered lists, unordered lists are also indented 2 spaces.</li>
<li>Unlike ordered lists, unordered lists use stars instead of numbers.<ul>
<li>Sub items are indented 2 more spaces.</li>
<li>Here's another sub item.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Links</h2>
<h3>Automatic links</h3>
<p>The simplest way to create a link is to just type it in:</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<pre><code class="language-text">http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/
</code></pre>
<h4>Formatted</h4>
<p>http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/</p>
<h3>Links with text</h3>
<p>If you want to use your own text for the link, here's how:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[link text here](link.address.here)
</code></pre>
<h4>Example</h4>
<pre><code class="language-text">[NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)
</code></pre>
<h4>Formatted</h4>
<p><a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a></p>
<h3>Local links</h3>
<p>It is also possible to link to a page on your computer, instead of a page somewhere on the Internet.</p>
<p>Local links have this form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[alt text](file:path)
</code></pre>
<p>Any spaces in the path must be converted to %20. For example, this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">file:my page.html
</code></pre>
<p>must be written as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">file:my%20page.html
</code></pre>
<p>The path is relative to the directory that the model file is in.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>The easiest way to link to files on your computer is to put them into the same directory as your model. Assuming you have a file named <code>index.html</code> in the same directory as your model, the link would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[Home](file:index.html)
</code></pre>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Here is another example where the file lives in a directory called docs, and docs is in the same directory as your model:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[Home](file:docs/index.html)
</code></pre>
<h2>Images</h2>
<p>Images are very similar to links, but have an exclamation point in front:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">![alt text](http://location/of/image)
</code></pre>
<p>(The alternate text is the text that gets displayed if the image is not found.)</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<pre><code class="language-text">![NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/images/netlogo-title-new.jpg)
</code></pre>
<h4>Formatted</h4>
<p><img alt="NetLogo" src="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/images/netlogo-title-new.jpg" /></p>
<h3>Local images</h3>
<p>Also very similar to links, it is possible to display an image on your computer instead of an image somewhere on the Internet. Assuming you have an image named <code>image.jpg</code>, local images look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">![alt text](file:path)
</code></pre>
<p>The path is relative to the directory that the model file is in.</p>
<p>As with local links, any spaces in the name of the file or the path must be converted to %20.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Like local links, the easiest way to display images on your computer is to put them into the same directory as your model. This example displays the image "Perspective Example.png", which resides in the same directory as this model (Info Tab Example).</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">![Example](file:Perspective%20Example.png)
</code></pre>
<h4>Formatted</h4>
<p><img alt="Example" src="file:Perspective%20Example.png" /></p>
<h3>Bundled images</h3>
<p>Images that are bundled with the model (See <a href="resource-manager.html">Resource Manager</a>) can also be displayed in the
Info tab. To display a bundled image, use the same syntax as for local files above, but omit the <code>file:</code> specifier.
For example, if there is a bundled image called <code>wolf-sheep</code>, you can include it in the Info tab as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">![Wolf Sheep](wolf-sheep)
</code></pre>
<p>To control various properties of an image, such as its size, you can use the equivalent HTML tag instead of Markdown
syntax, as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">&lt;img src=&quot;wolf-sheep&quot; alt=&quot;Wolf Sheep&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In either case, if the provided name refers to a resource that is not an image, a dummy image will be displayed in its
place.</p>
<h2>Block quotations</h2>
<p>Consecutive lines starting with &gt; will become block quotations.
You can put whatever text you like inside of it and you can also style it.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<pre><code class="language-text">&gt; Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
&gt; and four times seven is --- _oh dear!_
&gt; I shall never get to twenty at that rate!
</code></pre>
<h4>Formatted</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
and four times seven is --- <em>oh dear!</em>
I shall never get to twenty at that rate!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Code</h2>
<p>To include a short piece of code in a sentence, surround it with backticks (`).</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<pre><code class="language-text">You can create a single turtle with the `crt 1` command.
</code></pre>
<h4>Formatted</h4>
<p>You can create a single turtle with the <code>crt 1</code> command.</p>
<h2>Code blocks</h2>
<p>It is also possible to have blocks of code. To create a code block, indent every line of the block by 4 spaces. Another way is to surround it with a three backticks line before and after the block. (If you don't want your code to be colored as NetLogo code, add <code>text</code> after the first three backticks.)</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<pre><code class="language-text">About to start the code block.
Leave a blank line after this one, and then put the code block:

    ; a typical go procedure
    to go
      ask turtles
        [ fd 1 ]
      tick
    end
</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">About to start the code block.
Leave a blank line after this one, and then put the code block:

```
; a typical go procedure
to go
  ask turtles
    [ fd 1 ]
  tick
end
```
</code></pre>
<h4>Formatted</h4>
<p>About to start the code block.
Leave a blank line after this one, and then put the code block:</p>
<pre><code>; a typical go procedure
to go
  ask turtles
    [ fd 1 ]
  tick
end
</code></pre>
<h2>Superscripts and subscripts</h2>
<p>Superscripts and subscripts are useful for writing formulas, equations, footnotes and more. Subscripts appear half a character below the baseline, and are written using the HTML tag <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code>. Superscripts appear half a character above the baseline, and are written using the HTML tag <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code>.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<pre><code class="language-text">H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

2x&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

WWW&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4>Formatted</h4>
<p>H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
<p>2x<sup>4</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + 42</p>
<p>WWW<sup>[1]</sup></p>
<h2>Notes on usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Paragraphs, lists, code blocks and other features should be separated from each other with a blank line.  If you find that something isn't formatted the way you expected, it might be because you need to add a blank line before it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To prevent a special character from being treated as markup, put a backslash (<code>\</code>) before it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other features</h2>
<p>Markdown has additional features that we have not shown here.</p>
<p>We have tested the features shown above on a variety of systems.  If you use other Markdown features, you may find that they work on your computer, or not.  Even a feature that works on your computer might work differently, or not work at all, for someone with a different operating system or Java virtual machine.</p>
<p>If you want all NetLogo users to be able to read your Info tab, use only the features shown above.</p>
<p>More information about Markdown is at https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/. For rendering Markdown, NetLogo uses the <a href="https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java">Flexmark-java</a> library.</p>
