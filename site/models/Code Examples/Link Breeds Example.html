        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This code example shows how to create different kinds of links using link breeds.</p>
<p>The idea of link breeds is based on turtle breeds; both turtles and links can come in different breeds.</p>
<p>Note that many models that use links don't need link breeds.  If a model only has one kind of link, the links can be generic, unbreeded links.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>Each link breed is either directed or undirected.  When you create the breed, you must specify one or the other.</p>
<p>Two undirected links of the same breed cannot exist between the same two turtles.  Two directed links of the same breed cannot exist between the same two turtles in the same direction.</p>
