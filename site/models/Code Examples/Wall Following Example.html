        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>The turtles in this example follow walls made out of colored patches.  Some turtles try to keep the wall on their right; others keep the wall on their left.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>Consider a turtle that wants to keep a wall on its right.  If there is no wall immediately to its right, but there is a wall behind it on the right, it must turn right in order not to lose the wall.  If there's a wall directly in front of the turtle, it keeps turning left until there's free space in front of it.  Then it can move forward.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>The turtles always stay on patch centers and never move diagonally.</p>
<p>If there isn't a wall next to a turtle when it is born, it just moves forward until it finds one.</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>The <code>walk</code> procedure will get stuck in an infinite loop if a turtle finds itself surrounded by walls on all four sides.  The <code>setup</code> procedure detects such turtles and kills them off, so the model won't get stuck.  How would you change <code>walk</code> not to have this problem?  (You might need to do so in a model where the walls could move and grow.)</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>Turtles use the <code>patch-right-and-ahead</code> primitive to look at patches around themselves, relative to the direction the turtle is facing.</p>
