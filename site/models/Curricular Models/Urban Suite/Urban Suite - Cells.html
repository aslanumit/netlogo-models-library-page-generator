        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This is a model of 2d cellular automata.  It uses very simple rules to grow a form.  These forms may be very complex, or highly regular.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>At each step, each patch looks to see if it satisfies the rules defined for being turned on.  The rule is defined by the NEIGHBORHOOD chooser and the N-COUNT chooser.  If the number of currently turned on patches in the NEIGHBORHOOD around the patch is non-zero and also satisfies N-COUNT, then that patch has a chance to turn.  The change to turn on is defined by the PROBABILITY slider. If AGE-LIMIT is non-zero, then any patches that have been turned on for more ticks than AGE-LIMIT will be turned off.</p>
<p>The patches color shows their age, with darker patches being older than lighter patches.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Press SETUP to clear the board and create the initial seed patch.  Optionally, you may also press the RANDOM SEED button to create another seed in a random location.</p>
<p>Press the GO * 80 button and the model will run thru 80 ticks.  You may also press the STEP button to advance the model a single tick.  Lastly, the GO button will run the model an unlimited number of ticks, until it is pressed again.</p>
<p>The NEIGHBORS and N-COUNT choosers define the rule used to determine if a patch turns on or not, see the HOW IT WORKS section for details.</p>
<p>PROBABILITY is the chance a patch has of turning on if it satisfies the current rule.</p>
<p>AGE-LIMIT is the number of ticks a patch will stay turned on.  If AGE-LIMIT is 0, then there is no AGE-LIMIT defined and turned on patches stay that way forever.</p>
<p>The CYCLE COLORS button will make all turned on patches to cycle their colors.</p>
<p>The LIVE CELLS plot is a plot of the patches that are turned on at each tick.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>Which rules produce the most complex shape?</p>
<p>How many ticks does it take for the rules to fill up the world?</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>Some rules will result in a form that grows and fills the whole space, while others will have empty spots in them.</p>
<p>If you play with the PROBABILITY slider you can get asymmetrical forms, and also cause "mutations" in the growth of a form that would otherwise stop growing after a set number of ticks.  Such mutations can grow to fill in more patches because of the irregularity.</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>Add new neighborhoods to the NEIGHBORHOODS chooser.  You can do this by writing a reporter with the same name as your new neighborhood and adding the name to the chooser.</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>The scale-color primitive is used to set the color of patches according to their age.</p>
