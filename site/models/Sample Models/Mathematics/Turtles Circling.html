        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This is a new kind of mathematical investigation — we are investigating the emergent shape created by the movement of many turtles moving independently in simple ways. Each turtle is moving so as to create a circle of a fixed radius (set by the RADIUS slider).  What happens if the radius they are all circling at is changed in mid-action? Guess before you try it.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>The turtles create their circles by moving forward a little and turning right a little so as to end up with a circle of the specified radius. We start all the turtles on a circle of that radius so they move around the circle.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>The NUMBER slider determines the number of turtles circling.</p>
<p>The RADIUS slider determines the size of the circle each turtle moves on.</p>
<p>The SPEED slider determines how large a step each turtle take at each clock tick -- it determines the speed of circling.</p>
<p>The SETUP button creates NUMBER turtles on a circle of radius RADIUS centered at the point (0 0). The turtles are all headed so as to move around the circle.</p>
<p>The ALL-CIRCLE button starts the turtles circling. They are each drawing their own circle of radius RADIUS.</p>
<p>Change the value of the RADIUS slider while the turtles are circling.  <em>Before</em> you do it, what is your guess as to what will happen when you change the RADIUS?</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>What is happening to the shape described by the turtles?</p>
<p>How far out do the turtles go?</p>
<p>How far in do they come?</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>Try different values of both starting radius and changed radius.</p>
<p>You can also do further investigations with the following controls:</p>
<p>The ZERO-CIRCLE button lets you just focus on turtle zero's movement -- all the rest are stopped.</p>
<p>The DRAW-CIRCLE button lets you draw a circle on the patches with a radius equal to DRAW-RAD. This way you can track the movement of the turtles.</p>
<p>If the PLOT? switch is on, the plot will show a plot of turtle zero's distance from the origin as the turtles circle.</p>
<p>Try the command <code>lt 50</code> while the turtles are circling. Is this the same behavior as you observed when changing the radius?</p>
<p>In the Command Center, get a single (or several) turtles to trace their path using the command <code>pen-down</code> (<code>pd</code>).  This may help to show the relationship between the circles of individual turtles and the circle you see as they all move together.</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>What tools can you build to help visualize what is going on?</p>
