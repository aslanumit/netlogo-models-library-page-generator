        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>In a room of 23 people, what are the chances that some two of them will have the same birthday?</p>
<p>Make your best guess, then run the model and see how often it happens.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>Each turtle is randomly assigned a birthday.  If a turtle has the same birthday as another turtle in the room, it turns green.</p>
<p>The model doesn't take leap years into account (there are no February 29th birthdays).</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Press SETUP to initialize the model.</p>
<p>Press GO ONCE to generate a single room full of people.</p>
<p>Press GO to repeatedly generate many rooms full of people.  The SUCCESS RATE monitor will show what percentage of those rooms had at least one matching birthday.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>Is the success rate higher or lower than you expected?</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>To try a room with more people in it, edit the view and increase max-pycor.</p>
<p>How many people need to be in the room before the chance of a matching birthday is at least 90%?  (Is this higher or lower than you expected?)</p>
<p>Can you work out mathematically what the odds should be?  (Hint: start by considering the odds when the number of people is small.)</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>Include leap year birthdays in the list of possibilities.</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>This model uses lists a lot, including list primitives such as <code>map</code>, <code>foreach</code>, <code>item</code>, <code>position</code>, <code>sentence</code>, and <code>sort-on</code>.  Lists are used mostly to make the model display actual day names, instead of just numbers from 0 to 364.  Lists are also used when sorting the turtles by birthday.</p>
<h2>RELATED MODELS</h2>
<p>The ProbLab suite of models, in the Mathematics/Probability section, contains many explorations of basic questions about probability and statistics.</p>
