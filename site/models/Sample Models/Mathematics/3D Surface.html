        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This model maps turtles between Cartesian and spherical 3-dimensional coordinates.  To create the appearance of a curved 3D surface, the program generates turtles with random x- and z-coordinates, then computes each turtle's y-coordinate based on x and z, and time.  The cosine function is used in the formula to produce a curved surface.  Varying the y coordinate based on time produces motion.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>To render the surface in the NetLogo view, it maps from 3D to 2D coordinates as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>view x = turtle x + (turtle z) / 2
view y = turtle y + (turtle z) / 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, increasing z causes the turtle's apparent position to move both up and to the right.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Click the SETUP button to generate the turtles and place them on the surface.  Click the GO (forever) button to run the model, which continuously varies the turtles' y-coordinates to generate a wavelike motion.</p>
<p>The NUM-TURTLES slider determines the number of turtles that make up the surface.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>Notice that as the turtles move down (y-coordinate decreases) they become darker in color, and when they move up (y-coordinate increases) they become lighter.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>Experiment with the NUM-TURTLES slider.  How many turtles are needed to produce a realistic effect?  Why doesn't it keep getting better-looking indefinitely as you add more turtles?</p>
<p>In the <code>move</code> procedure, try other numbers besides 5 in front of and inside the cosine function.  Explain the new behavior!</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>Try changing the formula used to compute the y-coordinate to produce differently shaped surfaces.</p>
<p>See if you can draw not just a surface, but a three dimensional shape such as a cone or a sphere.</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>Notice the use of <code>scale-color</code> to change a turtle's color based on its y-coordinate. Also see the model "Wave Machine" for a version that uses patches rather than turtles to make a 3-D membrane.</p>
