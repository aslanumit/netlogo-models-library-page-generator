        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>The fractal that this model produces was discovered by the great Polish mathematician Waclaw Sierpinski in 1916.  Sierpinski was a professor at Lvov and Warsaw.  He was one of the most influential mathematicians of his time in Poland and had a worldwide reputation.  One of the moon's craters is named after him.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>The basic geometric construction of the Sierpinski tree goes as follows.  We begin with a single point on the plane and then apply a repetitive scheme of operations to it.  Grow a "spider" centered at this point by drawing three equal line segments directed to the vertices of an equilateral triangle.  Then at each vertex of the triangle repeat the construction --- grow a similar "spider" only scale it down by the factor of two.</p>

<p>The Sierpinski tree is closely related to the class of fractals called Sierpinski Carpets which includes the famous Sierpinski Triangle or as it is usually called The Sierpinski Gasket.</p>
<p>The features that characterize the Sierpinski tree are self-similarity and connectedness.  It is not always easy to determine if a fractal is connected.  It took almost a decade to prove the connectedness of the famous Mandelbrot set.  However connectedness is apparent from the way Sierpinski tree is generated; at each iteration the set is connected.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Push the SETUP button to clear the world and initialize globals.  Press repeatedly on the GO ONCE button to perform iterations of the Sierpinski algorithm.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>Notice the use of <code>hatch</code> primitive which makes it so simple to generate fractals like Sierpinski tree.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>Try to write a program that draws other self-similar shapes.  For instance try the rule below</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">                .               Step 0



                |
                |
                |
         ______________         Step 1
                |
                |
                |


                |
              __|__
                |
                |
        __|___________|__       Step 2
          |     |     |
                |
              __|__
                |
</code></pre>
<p>The resulting fractal is known in Algebraic Topology as a Universal Covering of the Figure Eight.</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>Notice how the curves are formed using several agents following the same rules.  Also, take note of the use of the <code>hatch</code> command.</p>
