        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This model displays a conic section: the hyperbola. The ancient Greeks called circles, ellipses, hyperbolas and parabolas conic sections because they can be generated geometrically by taking different cross sections of a cone. Later the conic sections were described algebraically as quadratic curves. In this model, the hyperbola shape is emergent, generated by the behavior of turtles that are trying to satisfy a distance criterion as below.  There are two additional models that demonstrate the use of an agent-based approach to exploring conic sections: Emergent Shapes - Ellipse, and Emergent Shapes - Parabola. You may find it helpful to explore the Ellipse model first.</p>
<p>A hyperbola is the set of points such that the absolute value of the difference of the distances to two fixed points (the foci) is constant. The constant is represented in this model by the variable CONIC-CONSTANT.</p>
<p>Here's an equivalent and less abstract description that may be easier to understand. Pick any two points in the plane and call them the foci of the hyperbola.  Choose a number that will be referred to as the "conic constant." Now pick any point in the plane and draw the 2 line segments between that point and each of the foci. Measure the length of each of these 2 line segments and substract the smaller length from the bigger length. If the number is equal to the conic constant than the point you chose is on the hyperbola. If not, then it isn't. The shape made by all the points for which their calculation is equal to the conic constant is the hyperbola.</p>
<p>Both the ellipse and the hyperbola are defined in terms of two fixed points (the foci) and a "conic constant." To decide if a point is on the conic section you compute the distance of the point to each of the foci. For an ellipse the sum of these distances must equal the "conic constant."  For a hyperbola subtracting the smaller distance from the larger one must equal the "conic constant."</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>In this model the turtles use feedback to make decisions about how to behave. They set out in random directions and then act on information as to whether or not they are getting closer to where they want to be. If they are getting closer, they continue moving forward in the direction they are going. If they are moving farther away, they set out in a new random direction.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<h3>Create a Hyperbola</h3>
<ul>
<li>Select the number of turtles with the NUM-TURTLES slider.</li>
<li>Use the slider to select the CONIC-CONSTANT. This corresponds to the absolute value of the difference of the distances to the two foci.</li>
<li>Press SETUP. The turtles will appear in random locations.</li>
<li>Press the GO button. The turtles will take small random steps at each tick.</li>
<li>Click a location to set one focus of the hyperbola. The turtles will continue to take small random steps at each tick.</li>
<li>Click a different location to set the other focus of the hyperbola. The turtles will move until they form a hyperbola.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Change the Hyperbola</h3>
<ul>
<li>Change the CONIC-CONSTANT using the slider. The turtles will automatically adjust themselves.</li>
<li>You can move either focus by clicking on it and dragging it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Distance Turtle</h3>
<p>A "distance turtle" is a randomly chosen turtle used to display the conic "distance." The distance turtle can only be visualized after both foci of the hyperbola have been selected. The distance turtle has red line segments connecting it to each of the foci. Each segment is labeled with its length. The absolute value of the difference between the lengths is always equal to the conic distance set by the slider.</p>
<h4>The Monitor</h4>
<p>The monitor labeled "conic distance of distance turtle" shows and explains the conic distance. An example would be "25.1 = 32.9 - 7.8 =  abs(difference of distances to foci).</p>
<h4>New Distance Turtle Button</h4>
<p>If the conic has been specified a new distance turtle is activated. If a distance turtle already exists it is replaced. If the hyperbola has not been specified, the distance turtle will be activated after the second focus is chosen.</p>
<h4>Clear Distance Turtle Button</h4>
<p>If a distance turtle exists it will be deactivated and its red line segments will be removed.</p>
<h3>Refresh Turtles Button</h3>
<p>This button moves the small green turtles to random locations.
If there is a distance turtle, it will persist.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>When forming a hyperbola, turtles adjust their positions so that the absolute value of the difference of the distances to the two user-defined foci equals the  CONIC-CONSTANT (a value determined by the user with a slider). If the foci are too close together, there is no way to satisfy this condition. What do the turtles do then?</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>Once you've made a hyperbola, play arpound with moving its foci. What hapens  to the green turtles when you move the foci?</p>
<p>You may be able to get a better feeling for the turtles' behavior if only a few turtles are alive at a time. Try setting num-turtles to a small value (like 16 or 1) and watching the turtles.
You can also slow down (or speed up) the movement of the turtles by either using the speed slider on the interface tool bar, or by clicking on "Settings..." and changing the frame rate.</p>
<p>Create  a distance turtle. Calculate the absolute value of the difference between the labeled lengths of its 2 red line segments. Now move one of the focuses. Recalculate the difference between the lengths of its 2 red lines. Did the calculated number change? Why do you think it stayed the same?</p>
<p>The constant conic-eps is set in the SETUP procedure. It determines how close the turtles have to be to their ideal 'distance' (the absolute value of the difference of distances to its foci) before they stop. Change its value --- what do you see? Why? Be sure to try some integer values.</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>Add a switch which allows the hyperbola to wrap the screen instead of stopping at the screen edge.</p>
<p>Add a button that moves one focus by a fixed distance in a random direction.</p>
<p>Add a switch that makes the distance turtle or the segments that extend from it change color depending on whether the conic distance has increased, decreased or stayed the same after its most recent step.</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>The mouse primitives are used for handling interaction with the user.
Link commands are used to display distances from the distance turtle.
The ifelse-value primitive is used to set condition dependent values.
The "carefully" primitive is used to avoid an error when testing if ticks have been started.</p>
