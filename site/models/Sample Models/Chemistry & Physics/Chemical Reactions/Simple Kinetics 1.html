        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This model demonstrates the kinetics of a simple reversible reaction. It demonstrates numerically that the application of the Principle of Stationary Concentrations is valid in this case.</p>
<p>In this model there are two kinds of molecules, green and red.  Green turtles turn into red turtles bimolecularly whereas red turtles turn back into pairs of green turtles monomolecularly.  You can control the rate at which this changes occur with sliders Kb and Ku.</p>
<p>The reaction here is a reversible reaction of the type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">                         Kb
        A + A &lt;=======&gt; B
                         Ku
</code></pre>
<p>An example of such a reaction would be dimerization of acetic acid:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">                                  Kb
        2 H C-COOH &lt;=======&gt; H C-COOH~...~HOOC-C H
       3           Ku     3                 3
</code></pre>
<p>This reaction is an example of a complex reaction which consists of two elementary reactions.  The forward bimolecular reaction</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">                        Kb
        A + A --------&gt; B
</code></pre>
<p>is characterized by the constant Kb and the reverse unimolecular reaction</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">             Ku
        B ---------&gt; A + A
</code></pre>
<p>is characterized by the constant Ku.</p>
<p>The system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) that describes the concentrations of A and B is given below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">        dA           2
        -- = -2Kb * A  + 2Ku * B        (1)
        dt


        dB         2
        -- = Kb * A  - Ku * B           (2)
        dt
</code></pre>
<p>The usual initial conditions are A(0) = Ao and B(0) = 0.  While it is possible to solve this system of ODE analytically, chemists usually apply the Principle of Stationary Concentrations when they investigate the kinetics of reactions of this type.  The Principle says that one can assume that the concentrations of the species stop changing from some point on after the system reaches equilibrium.  If concentrations are stationary, the derivatives</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">        dA               dB
        --  and  --
        dt               dt
</code></pre>
<p>are zero.  Hence one can replace the system of ODE above with the system of algebraic equations below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">                    2
        0 = -2Kb * A*   + 2Ku * B*              (1')

                  2
        0 = Kb * A*  - Ku * B*                  (2')
</code></pre>
<p>where concentrations marked with * are stationary concentrations.  The second equation (2') is linearly dependent on the first equation (1').  Luckily we also have another equation coming from the law of the conservation of mass:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">        A* + 2 * B* = Ao                        (3)
</code></pre>
<p>From equation (2') we can express B<em> in terms of A</em> :</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">                  Kb    2
        B*  = --  A*                    (4)
                  Ku
</code></pre>
<p>We can now plug in expression (4) into (3) and then we will have a quadratic equation in terms of A*:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">                  Kb   2
        A*  + -- A*  = Ao               (5)
          Ku
</code></pre>
<p>whose solution is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">             _____________
             |
             |             Kb
             |  1 + 4 * --  - 1
            \|          Ku
           --------------------         (6)
                  Kb
                         2 * --
                                 Ku
</code></pre>
<p>One can now find the stationary concentration of B using equation (4).</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Choose the values of Ku and Kb with appropriate sliders:
- Kb controls the rate of the forward reaction by which two green turtles turn bimolecularly into a single red turtle.
- Ku controls the rate of the reverse reaction, by which a red turtle turns unimolecularly into two green turtles.</p>
<p>Having chosen appropriate values of the constants, press SETUP to clear the world and create an initial number of green turtles.  Note: we do not create red turtles initially, although this could be done in principle.</p>
<p>Press GO to start the simulation.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>You will see turtles wandering around the world and changing color.  Pay more attention to the plot of the concentrations.  Do the plots soon reach stationary concentrations?</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>How do the stationary concentrations depend on the values of Kb and Ku?   You can change Ku and Kb while the model is running.   See if you can predict what the stationary concentrations will be with various combinations of Kb and Ku.</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>Try to implement the following reaction:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">                 Kb         K2
        A + A &lt;======&gt; B -------&gt; C
                 Ku
</code></pre>
<p>This reaction underlines a vast number of microbiological processes (e.g. fermentation).  You can read about its kinetics in any book on Biochemistry.  Look up the so-called Michaeles-Menten equation.  Does it check numerically?</p>
