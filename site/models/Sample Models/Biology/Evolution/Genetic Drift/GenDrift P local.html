        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This model is an example of random selection.  It shows that patches that randomly exchange colors converge on a single color. The idea, explained in more detail in Dennett's "Darwin's Dangerous Idea", is that trait drifts can occur without any particular purpose or 'selecting pressure'. In this version of the model, exchange of color can only occur between neighboring patches.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>The model starts with a random distribution of colors.  After this, at each time step, each patch in the grid changes its color to be the same as the color of one of the neighboring eight patches (chosen at random).</p>
<p>After enough time passes, a color will gain a slight dominance. By statistical advantage, a dominate color becomes more likely to win the entire grid.  However, because the process is random, there will usually be many series of dominant colors before one color finally wins.  A key aspect is that once a color disappears --- becomes extinct --- it can never reappear.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Use the COLORS slider to select the number of competing colors.</p>
<p>The SETUP button initializes the model.</p>
<p>The GO button starts it running.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>Notice that often colors can become quite dominant but still fail to win the grid.</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>Explore other rules by which patches might randomly influence each other.  What does it take for one color to "win out"?</p>
