        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>You and your partner have been arrested for robbing a bank and find yourselves in the classic prisoner's dilemma.  The police place each of you into separate rooms and come to you with the following proposal...</p>
<p>"We know you two did this, but don't have proof for anything but a minor charge of firearm possession that will give you a year of jail time.  Confess to the robbery and we will make sure the judge goes easy on you, 3 years.  If your partner confesses and you don't, we're going to throw the book at you and give you 5 years of prison time.  If your partner doesn't and you do, we will let you go free."</p>
<p>Should you remain silent or should you confess? How much jail time you will receive depends on your answer and also on your partner's answer to the same question. The following table summarizes the results of the four different situations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text"> Your Action | Partner's Action | Your Jail Time | Partner's Jail Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Silent          Silent               1                  1
   Silent          Confess              5                  0
   Confess         Silent               0                  5
   Confess         Confess              3                  3
</code></pre>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>SETUP: Place yourself in the prisoner's dilemma</p>
<p>ANSWER: Answer the police and receive your sentence.</p>
<p>YOU-SILENT?: If you are silent, you will not confess.  If you are not silent, you will confess.</p>
<p>PARTNER-SILENCE-KNOWN?: When on, this switch allows you to control the actions of your partner with the PARTNER-SILENT? switch.</p>
<p>PARTNER-SILENT?: If your partner is silent, he will not confess.  If he is not silent, he will confess.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>Turn off PARTNER-SILENCE-KNOWN?.  Attempt to minimize your prison sentence.  Can you do better than your partner?  Why or why not?</p>
<p>What strategy is best for the group as a whole?</p>
<p>Describe a real life scenario that is similar to the prisoner's dilemma, preferably one from your own life.  What was the best decision?  Why?</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
