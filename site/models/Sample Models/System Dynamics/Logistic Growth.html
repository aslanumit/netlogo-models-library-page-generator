        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This is a model of a logistic growth curve using the System Dynamics Modeler.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>At each step the difference equations n * (1 - n) is calculated and added to the stock.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Press the SETUP button, then press the GO button to run the model.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>View the STOCK monitor to see the current value of STOCK.</p>
<p>View the plot to observe the growth of STOCK over time.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>What do you think might happen if the initial value of stock is larger than 1? less than zero?</p>
