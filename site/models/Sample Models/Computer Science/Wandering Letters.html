        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This model illustrates how to build a word processor where each of the letters acts independently.  Each letter knows only which letter comes before it and how long its word is.  When the letters or margins are moved, the letters find their own ways back to their proper locations.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>Each letter looks both for changes in the margins and for being out of sync with its "leader", which is the letter before it in the text.  If it is not in its proper place relative to its leader, it takes a step in its leader's direction.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>SETUP initializes the margins and some sample sentences for the text.</p>
<p>GO starts and stops the simulation.</p>
<p>The LEFT-MARGIN and RIGHT-MARGIN sliders let you move the sliders.  You can move these sliders while GO is running and the letters will adjust on the fly.</p>
<p>SCATTER LETTERS scatters the letters randomly about the View.  You can press this even while GO is running.</p>
<p>LINE-SPACING controls how much space there is between lines.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>How do the letters find their way home?  In what ways is this different from the behavior of letters in a standard word processor?</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>While GO is pressed try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving the margin sliders</li>
<li>Changing the spacing</li>
<li>Pushing the scatter button</li>
<li>Combinations of all three</li>
</ul>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>Can you extend the model so the user can type his/her own message?  You might want to use the user-input primitive for this.</p>
<p>Sometimes a space will end up at the beginning of a new line.  Try to fix it so that spaces are ignored at the ends of lines.</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>Note the use of a blank shape to make a turtle that is invisible except for its label.</p>
<h2>CREDITS AND REFERENCES</h2>
<p>This model is based on a Smalltalk program of the same name developed by Ted Kaehler of Disney Interactive.</p>
