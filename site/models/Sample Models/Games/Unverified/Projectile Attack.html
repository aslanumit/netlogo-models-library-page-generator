        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This model is based on the classic game Tank Wars. Players must adjust angle and power of fire to hit a target with a projectile. Several factors, including gravity and wind must be taken into account.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>The warhead is fired and moves ballistically towards its target.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>The SETUP button creates a new randomly-positioned target and obstacle wall.</p>
<p>The GO button causes the game logic to be active and must be pressed anytime the game is in play.</p>
<p>The FIRE button launches the projectile with the currently specified parameters.</p>
<p>The WIND slider adjusts the direction and magnitude of the wind.</p>
<p>Properties of the obstacle wall can be configured including its height (WALL-HEIGHT slider), it's location (WALL-POSITION slider), and what effect it has on wind (WALL-BLOCKS-WIND? switch)</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>Try to hit the target!</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>This model uses the <code>tie</code> command for links, to conveniently make it so that changing the heading of the tank causes its gun to swivel and the "aiming arrow" to also swivel.</p>
<p>This model also fakes having no ceiling to the world, by having the shell (projectile) wrap around to the bottom of the view, but it is hidden until it comes back down again.</p>
