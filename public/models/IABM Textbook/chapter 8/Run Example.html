<p>This model is from Chapter Eight of the book "Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling: Modeling Natural, Social and Engineered Complex Systems with NetLogo", by Uri Wilensky &amp; William Rand.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wilensky, U. &amp; Rand, W. (2015). Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling: Modeling Natural, Social and Engineered Complex Systems with NetLogo. Cambridge, MA. MIT Press.</li>
</ul>
<p>This model is in the IABM Textbook folder of the NetLogo Models Library. The model, as well as any updates to the model, can also be found on the textbook website: http://www.intro-to-abm.com/.</p>
<h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This model illustrates how to use the <code>run</code> command in NetLogo, which enables the runtime execution of different commands that are encoded as text. This is often useful if you want to construct turtle commands on the fly.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>The model initially creates 100 agents and a list of commands, such as <code>bk 1</code>, <code>lt 90</code>, etc. It then sets the strategy for each of the agents to a random set of five of those commands. When the model runs, the agents simply executes their strategy.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Press SETUP to create the agents and strategies.</p>
<p>Press GO to run the agent strategies for some time.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>Do all the agents do the same thing? Can you tell the difference between the different strategies?</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>Change the list of commands and see how that affects the results of the model.</p>
<h2>RELATED MODELS</h2>
<p>Sandpile Simple demonstrates the use of the <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#run"><code>run</code></a> primitive with <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/programming.html#tasks">tasks</a> instead of strings.</p>
