<h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This model models the movement of cars on a highway. Each car follows a simple set of rules: it slows down (decelerates) if it sees a car close ahead, and speeds up (accelerates) if it doesn't see a car ahead. Cars start at a random speed between 0.1 and 1. This model extends the Traffic Basic model, from the social science section of the NetLogo models library, to include a utility function for the cars.</p>
<p>In this version of the model, we have the cars change their speeds in order to improve their fuel efficiencies. As a result, the agents have to speed up and slow down at different times than they do in the Traffic Basic model in order to minimize their gas usage while still not causing accidents. Giving the agents this type of decision-making process gives them a utility-based form of agent cognition in which they attempt to maximize a utility function—namely, their fuel efficiency.</p>
<p>In the language of utility functions, each car agent is minimizing a function <em>f</em>, defined by:</p>
<p><em>f</em>(<em>v</em>) = |<em>v</em> − <em>v</em>*|</p>
<p>where <em>v</em> is the current velocity of the car and <em>v</em>* is the most efficient velocity.</p>
<p>The model sets the optimal speed for the cars (best fuel efficiency) to be 0.45. If the acceleration rule speeds the car past the optimal speed, the car decelerates instead of accelerating.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Click on the SETUP button to set up the cars.</p>
<p>Set the NUMBER slider to change the number of cars on the road.</p>
<p>Click on GO to start the cars moving.  Note that they wrap around the world as they move, so the road is like a continuous loop.</p>
<p>The ACCELERATION slider controls the rate at which cars accelerate (speed up) when there are no cars ahead.</p>
<p>When a car sees another car right in front, it matches that car's speed and then slows down a bit more.  How much slower it goes than the car in front of it is controlled by the DECELERATION slider.</p>
<p>The EFFICIENT-SPEED slider is the basis of the utility function for the cars. Cars slow down if they are exceeding it.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>How are the results different from the Traffic Basic model? Are traffic jams more or less likely than in the Traffic Basic model? If so, why? If not, why not?</p>
<p>How does the model's behavior change with different values of EFFICIENT-SPEED?</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>Try very low and very high values of EFFICIENT-SPEED. Are there values where the model behavior changes qualitatively?</p>
<p>Can you think of a strategy for finding the EFFICIENT-SPEED that leads to the highest overall average speed for cars?</p>
<p>What happens when you start with a very low EFFICIENT-SPEED and gradually increase it?</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>The value of EFFICIENT-SPEED is currently the same for every car. What if each car had a different efficient speed? Use <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#random-reporters"><code>random-normal</code></a> to give each car a different efficient speed while keeping the average close to the value of the EFFICIENT-SPEED slider. But be careful, as <code>random-normal</code> is unbounded: it has a small probability of giving very high or very low values. Make sure that you also set a minimum and a maximum for efficient speed.</p>
