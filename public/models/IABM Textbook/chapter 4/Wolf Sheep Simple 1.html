<p>This model is from Chapter Four of the book "Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling: Modeling Natural, Social and Engineered Complex Systems with NetLogo", by Uri Wilensky &amp; William Rand.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wilensky, U. &amp; Rand, W. (2015). Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling: Modeling Natural, Social and Engineered Complex Systems with NetLogo. Cambridge, MA. MIT Press.</li>
</ul>
<p>This model is in the IABM Textbook folder of the NetLogo Models Library. The model, as well as any updates to the model, can also be found on the textbook website: http://www.intro-to-abm.com/.</p>
<h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This is the first model in a set of five models in chapter four of the textbook that build toward a predator prey model of population dynamics.  This first model creates a population of sheep and gives them "wiggly" movement.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>The model creates a population of sheep that wander around the green landscape.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Pressing SETUP will create the population of 100 sheep.  After this, press the GO button to make the sheep move around the landscape.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>How many sheep can you create?  How does this affect the visualization?</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>Set the NUMBER-OF-SHEEP slider to different settings and see what the results are.</p>
<h2>RELATED MODELS</h2>
