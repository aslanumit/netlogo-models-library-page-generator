<h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This is a kind of mathematical investigation — we are investigating the emergent shape created by the movement of many turtles (arrows) moving independently in simple ways. Each turtle is moving a little step forward and taking a little turn right to stay on a circle of radius 20.  What happens if the we slightly increase the step forward they are taking  in mid-action? Guess before you try it.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>We start with 40 turtles on a circle of radius 20 facing clockwise around the circle.
The turtles move forward .35 units and turn right 1 degree to stay on the circle.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>The SETUP button creates 40 turtles on a circle of radius 20 centered at the point (0 0). The turtles are all facing around the circle.</p>
<p>The GO button starts the turtles circling. They move around the circle.</p>
<p>The CHANGE-SPEED button increase the turtles' step size to .5 units.  <em>Before</em> you do it, what is your guess as to what will happen when you change the step-size?</p>
<p>The TRACK-TURTLE button selects one turtle at random to draw its path, so you can keep better track of its movement.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>What is happening to the shape described by the turtles?</p>
<p>How far out do the turtles go?</p>
<p>How far in do they come?</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>In the Command Center, try the command <code>lt 50</code> while the turtles are circling. Is this the same behavior as you observed when changing the speed?</p>
<p>Get a single (or several) turtles to trace their path using the command <code>pen-down</code> (<code>pd</code>).  This may help to show the relationship between the movement of individual turtles and the circle you see as they all move together.</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>What tools can you build to help visualize what is going on?</p>
<p>Can you add a plot to show a turtle's distance from the origin as the turtles circle?</p>
<p>Can you stop all the turtles and focus on only one turtle's movement?</p>
<p>Can you draw a circle (with a turtle's pen) on the screen to serve as a baseline?</p>
<p>Make sliders to control the original radius and/or the number of turtles.</p>
