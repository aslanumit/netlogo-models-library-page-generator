<h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This project models the behavior of turtles of different ethnicities in a mythical pond. All the turtles get along with each other. But each turtle wants to make sure that it lives near some of "its own." The simulation shows how these individual preferences ripple through the pond, leading to large-scale patterns.</p>
<p>This project was inspired by Thomas Schelling's writings about social systems (particularly with regards to housing segregation in cities).</p>
<p>This model is an extension of the Segregation Simple model. It allows you to set up more than 2 ethnicities of agents.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Click the SETUP button to set up the turtles. There are equal numbers of each color turtles. The turtles move around until there is at most one turtle on a patch.  Click GO to start the simulation. If turtles don't have enough same-color neighbors, they jump to a nearby patch.</p>
<p>The NUMBER slider controls the total number of turtles. (It takes effect the next time you click SETUP.) The NUMBER-OF-ETHNICITIES slider controls the number of different types of turtles, each a different color. The %-SIMILAR-WANTED slider controls the percentage of same-color turtles that each turtle wants among its neighbors. For example, if the slider is set at 30, each green turtle wants at least 30% of its neighbors to be green turtles.</p>
<p>The "PERCENT SIMILAR" monitor shows the average percentage of same-color neighbors for each turtle. It starts at about 0.5, since each turtle starts (on average) with an equal number of red and green turtles as neighbors. The "PERCENT UNHAPPY" monitor shows the percent of turtles that have fewer same-ethnicity neighbors than they want (and thus want to move).  Both monitors are also plotted.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>When you execute SETUP, the turtles are randomly distributed throughout the pond. But many turtles are "unhappy" since they don't have enough neighbors of the same ethnicity. The unhappy turtles jump to new locations in the vicinity. But in the new locations, they might tip the balance of the local population, prompting other turtles to leave. If a few red turtles move into an area, the local blue or orange turtles might leave. But when the blue or orange turtles move to a new area, they might prompt red turtles to leave that area, and so on.</p>
<p>Over time, the number of unhappy turtles decreases. But the pond becomes more segregated, with clusters of each ethnicity.</p>
<p>Again, relatively small individual preferences can lead to significant overall segregation. The exact numbers depend on how many ethnicities you have, and on the random distribution of their preferences for similarity.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>Try different values for %-SIMILAR-WANTED. How does the overall degree of segregation change?</p>
<p>Try different values for NUMBER-OF-ETHNICITIES. Does the overall segregation pattern change? How so, and why?</p>
<p>If each turtle wants at least 40% same-ethnicity neighbors, what percentage (on average) do they end up with?</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>In the UPDATE-GLOBALS procedure, note the use of SUM, COUNT and WITH to compute the percentages displayed in the monitors and plots.</p>
