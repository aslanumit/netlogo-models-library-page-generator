<p>This model is from Chapter Three of the book "Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling: Modeling Natural, Social and Engineered Complex Systems with NetLogo", by Uri Wilensky &amp; William Rand.</p>

<p>This model is in the IABM Textbook folder of the NetLogo Models Library. The model, as well as any updates to the model, can also be found on the textbook website: http://www.intro-to-abm.com/.</p>
<h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This project simulates the spread of a fire through a forest.  It shows that the fire's chance of reaching the right edge of the forest depends critically on the density of trees. This is an example of a common feature of complex systems, the presence of a non-linear threshold or critical parameter. This model extends the Fire Simple Extension 2 model by adding BIG-JUMPS.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>The fire starts on the left edge of the forest, and spreads to neighboring trees. The fire spreads in four directions: north, east, south, and west.</p>
<p>Unlike the first few Fire models, this adds long distance transmission of fire, which means that fire can jump across unburnt stretches of forest.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Click the SETUP button to set up the trees (green) and fire (red on the left-hand side).</p>
<p>Click the GO button to start the simulation.</p>
<p>The DENSITY slider controls the density of trees in the forest. (Note: Changes in the DENSITY slider do not take effect until the next SETUP.)</p>
<p>The PROBABILITY-OF-SPREAD slider affects how the fire spreads from patch to patch.</p>
<p>The SOUTH-WIND-SPEED slider affects how strong the wind is from the south.  You can set it negative to create a north wind.</p>
<p>The WEST-WIND-SPEED slider affects how strong the wind is from the south.  You can set it negative to create a east wind.</p>
<p>The BIG-JUMPS? switch controls whether or not sparks can jump across long distances.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>Compare this model to the Fire Simple Extension 2 model.  How do the sparks affect the results?</p>
<p>Does adding spark jumping change the overall amount of forest burned? Why do you think that might be?</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>Try running the same settings with BIG-JUMPS? turned off and on, how does this affect the results?</p>
