        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This model was built to test and demonstrate the functionality of the GIS NetLogo extension.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>This model loads four different GIS datasets: a point file of world cities, a polyline file of world rivers, a polygon file of countries, and a raster file of surface elevation. It provides a collection of different ways to draw the data to the drawing layer, run queries on it, and transform it into NetLogo Turtles or Patch data.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Select a map projection from the projection menu, then click the setup button. You can then use all other features of the mode. See the code tab for specific information about how the different buttons work.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>Most of the commands in the Code tab can be easily modified to display slightly different information. For example, you could modify <code>highlight-large-cities</code> to highlight small cities instead, by replacing <code>gis:find-greater-than</code> with <code>gis:find-less-than</code>.</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>This model doesn't do anything particularly interesting, but you can easily copy some of the code from the Code tab into a new model that uses your own data, or does something interesting with the included data. See the other GIS code example, GIS Gradient Example, for an example of this technique.</p>
<h2>RELATED MODELS</h2>
<p>GIS Gradient Example provides another example of how to use the GIS extension.</p>
