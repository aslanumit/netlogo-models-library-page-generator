        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This example demonstrates the use of the <code>view2.5d</code> extension for turtle views. The <code>view2.5d</code> extension allows properties of turtles to be visualized using their height and stem color.</p>
<p>This example also shows how links between turtles can be visualized in three dimensions.</p>
<p>The model opens a separate "Turtle View" window by calling:</p>
<pre><code>  view2.5d:turtle-view window-name turtles [ the-turtle -&gt; [height] of the-turtle ]
</code></pre>
<p>The anonymous reporter supplied to the <code>view2.5d:turtle-view</code> primitive is used by the extension to set the height of each turtle.</p>
<p>The anonymous reporter supplied to the <code>view2.5d:set-turtle-stem-color</code> primitive is used by the extension to set the stem color of each turtle.</p>
<p>The method <code>view2.5d:set-turtle-stem-thickness</code> is used to set the stem color of each turtle.</p>
<p>In the <code>go</code> procedure, we use <code>view2.5d:update-turtle-view</code> to refresh the turtle view using the current state of the model.</p>
<p>Several extension-specific methods are used to control the three dimensional visualization of this "Turtle View":</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>view2.5d:set-observer-distance</code> sets the observer's distance from its "focus point."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>view2.5d:set-observer-heading</code> sets the heading of the observer's angular perspective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>view2.5d:set-observer-pitch</code> sets the pitch of the the observer's angular perspective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>view2.5d:set-observer-x-focus</code> sets the x coordinate the observer is "looking at" in the patch plane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>view2.5d:set-observer-y-focus</code> sets the y coordinate the observer is "looking at" in the patch plane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>view2.5d:set-z-scale</code> sets the scale of the z-axis, in this case making the turtles "taller".</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, please refer to the <code>view2.5d</code> extension documentation.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>At each tick the height and turtle stem color are changed based on properties of the turtles within a small radius.</p>
<p>The height is changed by the difference between a turtle's height and the average height of its near neighbors (if any). That means if a turtle is at a lower height than the average of its neighbors, its height will increase, and if a turtle's height is higher than the average of its neighbors, its height will decrease.</p>
<p>The stem color is changed to the average stem color of its near neighbors (if any).</p>
<p>The turtle takes on the color of its stem.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>The model has standard SETUP and GO buttons.</p>
<p>The NUM-TURTLES slider determines the initial number of turtles.</p>
<p>The link related interface items take effect at the next tick.</p>
<p>The links are visible when the SHOW-LINKS? switch is set to ON, and invisible if it is set to OFF.</p>
<p>There is a chooser to chose the LINK-COLOR.</p>
<p>A slider is used to set the LINK-THICKNESS. Note that the thickness appears much larger in the small 2D inset.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>Use the NUM-TURTLES slider to explore how increasing or decreasing the number of turtles affects how quickly the height and stem color of the turtles changes.</p>
<p>Use the switch, chooser, or slider to instantaneously change the visualization of links.</p>
<p>In the 3D window, explore the effect of the different View Options by selecting different combinations of check boxes and switching between Link Options by using radio buttons.</p>
<p>Note that links are shown using the 3D option by default. To programmatically start a model with links shown in 2D, add the following line</p>
<pre><code>  view2.5d:show-links-xy-plane  window-name
</code></pre>
<p>after the line with the <code>view2.5d:turtle-view</code> command.</p>
