        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This simple model communicates with the sensors and output ports of a GoGo Board, an open source, easy-to-build, low cost, general purpose circuit board designed for educational projects. It uses the <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/GoGo-HID-Extension"><code>gogo</code> extension</a>, which interfaces with GoGo boards running Human Interface Driver (HID) firmware.</p>
<p>This model helps you test your connection to your GoGo Board, and serves as a starting point for building NetLogo activities that interact with the physical world. For a more complete version of this model, try the GoGoMonitor.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>The GoGo Extension for NetLogo provides primitives for communicating with a Gogo Board
connected to your computer's USB port. You can get information from sensors and control motors, LEDs, light, and relays.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Connect a GoGo Board to your computer's USB port . Then connect sensors, motors, LEDs, relays, and lights to the board.</p>
<p>The GoGo board will beep when it is plugged in, letting you know it is connected. Try clicking the BEEP, LED ON, and LED OFF buttons to confirm the board is receiving data from the model. These three buttons control on-board features of the GoGo board, so no additional sensors need be connected.</p>
<p>The sensor monitor shows the value of sensor 1.</p>
<p>The output port controls let you control the motors and lights connected to the output ports "A" of your GoGo board.</p>
<p>A-ON turns the output port(s) on.</p>
<p>A-OFF turns the output port(s) off.</p>
<p>A-CLOCKWISE/COUNTER-CLOCKWISE control the direction of current to the output port(s).  If a motor is connected to the output port, this determines the direction of motion.</p>
<p>To change the amount of current going to the output port(s), set the A-POWER slider, then press the SET-A-POWER button.</p>
<p>To plot sensor 1 values, start the PLOT SENSOR forever button.  At any time, you can clear the plot with the CLEAR PLOT button.  To export the data in your plot, right-click (on Macs, control-click) on the plot and choose "Export...".</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>Try connecting different sensors to the GoGo Board: temperature sensors, light sensors, pressure sensors, etc.</p>
<p>Connect various motors, lights, and other circuits to the GoGo Board's output ports.</p>
<p>To find out where to buy sensors and motors, go to the GoGo Board website (www.gogoboard.org)</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>Modify the plot to plot more sensors.
Add filters and normalization to the sensor data.
Using a light sensor, make a turtle move forward when it's dark, and stop when there is light.</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>This model uses the NetLogo GoGo Extension. For more information, see the GoGo Extension section of the NetLogo User Manual.</p>
