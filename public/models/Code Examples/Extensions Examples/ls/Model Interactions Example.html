        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This is a code example for showing interactions between models in a LevelSpace model system. It shows how the temperature in the Climate Change model can be programmed to influence the grass regrowth time in the Wolf Sheep Predation model.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>The model creates a Wolf Sheep Predation child model and a Climate Change child model. It then sets up the Climate Change model and runs it until it is stable. Finally, this model runs both the Wolf Sheep Predation and Climate Change model, and changes the speed at which grass regrows in the Wolf Sheep Predation model based on the current temperature in the Climate Change model.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Click SETUP to create the two models, and GO to run the models.</p>
<p>You can now modify the various values in the Climate Change model's window, and observe how they affect the dynamics of the ecosystem.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>Try to dramatically change the temperature in the Climate Change model. How quickly do you see a change in the ecosystem?</p>
<p>Try to slowly change the temperature in the Climate Change model. Are there any critical thresholds for the amount of CO2 in the model system?</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>Animals produce greenhouse gases. Try to modify the model so the animals in the ecosystem somehow introduce greenhouse gases in the Climate Change model.</p>
<p>The amount of grass in the Wolf Sheep Predation model could affect the albedo in the Climate Change model. Try to implement that in the code.</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>This model uses LevelSpace to build a small model-system of two models, and then have them affect each other.</p>
