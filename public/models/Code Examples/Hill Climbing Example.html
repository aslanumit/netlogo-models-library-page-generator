        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This example shows how to make turtles climb hills -- or descend into valleys -- using the <code>uphill</code>, <code>uphill4</code>, <code>downhill</code>, and <code>downhill4</code> commands.  The same technique is useful for modeling any kind of creature that follows a gradient in its environment.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>These commands always make the turtle move to the center of a patch.</p>
<p><code>uphill</code> and <code>downhill</code> make the turtle look at all eight neighboring patches (including diagonal neighbors).  <code>uphill4</code> and <code>downhill4</code> only look at the four neighboring patches (to the north, south, east, and west).</p>
<p>With the <code>uphill</code> and <code>downhill</code> commands, diagonal moves are longer (1.414...) than vertical or horizontal moves (1.0).  If you use the <code>uphill4</code> and <code>downhill4</code> commands, all moves are the same length (1.0).</p>
<p>If there is a tie between neighboring patches, NetLogo breaks the tie randomly.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>In the <code>go</code> procedure in the Code tab, change <code>uphill</code> to <code>uphill4</code>, <code>downhill</code>, or <code>downhill4</code> and observe the results.</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>If you look at the entry for <code>uphill</code> in the NetLogo Dictionary, it shows some code that does the exact same thing as the primitive does. If you need to do something that is similar to the primitive, but different in so way, you could use that code as a starting point.</p>
