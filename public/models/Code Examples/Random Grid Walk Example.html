        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This code example is a demo of a basic random walk, constrained to lie on a grid.  At each step, the yellow turtle changes its heading randomly, but always in multiples of 90, so the turtle is always facing due north, east, south, or west.  At each step, the turtle always lands on the center of a patch.</p>
<p>Two slightly different kinds of walk are demonstrated:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In WALK1, the turtle's heading at each time step is completely random.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In WALK2, the turtle never makes an immediate about face (180 degree turn). Thus, it will tend to proceed in one direction for longer.  This is more similar to how a person or animal might wander.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>The monitors show that the turtle's xcor and ycor are always exact multiples of 1.0.  That means that the turtle is always on a patch center.</p>
