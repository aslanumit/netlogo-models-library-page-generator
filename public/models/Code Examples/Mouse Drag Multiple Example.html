        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This is an example of how to use the mouse to select and drag multiple turtles.</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>We use two breeds of turtle:</p>
<ul>
<li>one to represent the agents being selected and dragged</li>
<li>one to represent the sides of the selection rectangle</li>
</ul>
<p>You might think that the sides of the selection rectangle might better be represented by links.  This would work, but it would have two drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A third breed of turtles would be required in order to represent the corners of the box (because links must have turtles to connect).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It would work fine in a non-wrapping world, but in a wrapping world, a large selection rectangle would be drawn incorrectly because the sides would use the shortest possible path to connect the corners, and that path would sometimes wrap around the world boundaries.</p>
</li>
</ol>
