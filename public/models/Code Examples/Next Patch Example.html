        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This code example demonstrates how to find out what patch a turtle would cross into next if it were to move forward continuously.</p>
<p>Note that NetLogo doesn't actually have continuous motion; turtles can only move by "jumping" a finite amount.  So it's rare that you need the code in this code example; normally a turtle can just use the <code>patch-ahead</code> primitive to find out where it would land if it jumped a certain distance.</p>
<p>See the Code tab for further commentary.</p>
<h2>RELATED MODELS</h2>
<p>This code is used in the Rugby model, in Sample Models under Mathematics.</p>
