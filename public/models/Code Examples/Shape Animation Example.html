        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This code example shows how to use shapes to create animations.  In this example, there is a walking person and growing flowers.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>A counter is used to increment the shape to be used in each animation.</p>
<p>For the person, each progressive frame of the person walking has a different shape.  There are 9 shapes total.  Each progressive shape is numbered as person_#, where the # is one higher then the shape that came before.  After final numbered shape (person_9), the shapes repeat from the start (person_1) and continue to cycle through the remaining shapes.  The person is moved forward a small bit with each new shape, to give the illusion of walking.</p>
<p>For the flowers, each progressive frame of their growth shows the development of the flower from a small seedling to a fully grown flower.  Each frame has a new shape.  Each progressive shape is numbered as flower_#, where the # is one higher then the shape that came before.  After final numbered shape (flower_16), the shapes stop incrementing and the flower is shown as fully grown.</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>The model has a frame rate setting of 15 frames per second, for smooth animation that isn't too fast.  The speed can be further adjusted by the user using the speed slider.</p>
