        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This model investigates emergent patterns in a demographic property of a population: the adult sex ratio (ASR). ASR is defined as the ratio of males to females in the adult population. Most sexually reproducing organisms have an ASR of 1:1. Fisher (1930) explains a rationale for this phenomenon based on natural selection, irrespective of a particular mechanism of sex-determination, which is now known as Fisher’s principle (Hamilton, 1967).</p>
<p>This model is based on Fisher's assumptions of biparentism and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance">Mendelian inheritance</a>.
It allows user to explore the emergence of the Fisherian Sex Ratio (1:1) across a wide range of initial sex-ratios and life-history traits.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>This is a population dynamics model of sexually reproducing organisms. The demographic changes in the population as well as the adult sex ratio are plotted as the time progresses.</p>
<p>There are two types of individuals in the model:
- <em>Males</em> (Indicated by green color)
- <em>Females</em> (Indicated by blue color if not carrying a child and indicated by orange color if carrying a child)</p>
<p>At every time-step the individuals:
- Age and check if dead – a random value of longevity is assigned at birth if an agent’s age is more than that value it dies
- Move randomly
- Search for an adult partner if <em>male</em>. This procedure involves mating, which is dependent on the assigned value of the mating chance. If agents mate, the <em>female</em> carries. (For simplicity, the mating chance in this model incorporates conception-chance as well.)
- Reproduce if <em>female</em></p>
<p>The genetic mechanism of influencing the proportion of <em>male</em> children in the litter is abstracted as a parameter, called MALE-CHILD-CHANCE. Each <em>male</em> and <em>female</em> carry a trait called MALE-CHILD-CHANCE. This determines the probability of a child being <em>male</em>. In this basic model, the sex of the child is equally influenced by the MALE-CHILD-CHANCE values of both the parents.</p>
<p>A child inherits this trait from its parents with a mutation. The inherited value for the trait is drawn from a random normal distribution with a mean equal to the average of MALE-CHILD-CHANCE of the parents.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Using the sliders, set your desired initial population and individual values (see the <strong>Sliders</strong> section below for more details). Click the SETUP button to setup the population. To run the model, click the GO button.</p>
<p>The plots and monitors allow users to observe population-level changes and see the emergence of the Fisherian sex-ratio equilibrium.</p>
<h3>Sliders</h3>
<p>INITIAL-POPULATION-SIZE: the initial number of individuals in the population
INITIAL-ADULT-SEX-RATIO: the initial adult-sex-ratio (number of males/number individual * 100) in the population
INITIAL-AVERAGE-MALE-CHILD-CHANCE: the initial average male-child-chance of all the individuals in the population
MEAN-LONGEVITY: the average longevity (number of ‘ticks’ an individual lives)
GESTATION-PERIOD: the number of 'ticks' a female is going to carry a child
MAXIMUM-LITTER-SIZE: the maximum number of children a female would give birth to after she completes gestation
MATING-CHANCE: the probability that a female mates with a male when a male finds a female partner</p>
<h3>Plots</h3>
<p>ADULT SEX RATIO: shows the percentage of male agents
POPULATION AVERAGE MALE-CHILD-CHANCE: shows how the population's male-child-chance changes over time
GENDER DISTRIBUTION: shows numbers of agents of both sexes
MATING SUCCESS RATIO (MALE TO FEMALE): shows how the ratio of male mating success to female mating success changes over time</p>
<h3>Monitors</h3>
<p>ADULT SEX RATIO (ASR): the proportion of male agents, at the moment
RUNNING MEAN OF ASR: the average of adult sex ratio in the past 1000 ticks
RUNNING STD DEV OF ASR: standard deviation of adult sex ratio in the past 1000 ticks</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>When you run the model, notice how the number of males and females vary in the GENDER DISTRIBUTION plot. Also, notice that for a wide range of parameter values, if you run the simulation long enough (4000 to 5000 ticks), the ASR converges to 50% as seen in the ADULT-SEX-RATIO plot.</p>
<p>Notice that the average value of the trait male-child-chance across all agents in the AVERAGE MALE-CHILD-CHANCE plot also converges to 0.5 for a wide range of parameters.</p>
<p>Also notice that once the ASR reaches 50%, it is stable around the 50% point. The AVERAGE MALE-CHILD-CHANCE is also stable around the value of 0.5.</p>
<p>Vary the INITIAL-SEX-RATIO and INITIAL-AVERAGE-MALE-CHILD-CHANCE, which are the two variables that affect the sex ratio the most in this model. How do these variables relate to the mating success of each sex?</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>Try setting different values of INITIAL-ADULT-SEX-RATIO and INITIAL-AVERAGE-MALE-CHILD-CHANCE to see how that affects the emergence of the adult sex ratio equilibrium.</p>
<p>See if you can change the parameters and see if you can get to a different stable ASR.</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>This model implements <code>search-for-a-partner</code> by a male. See if you can change it and make it a female action.</p>
<p>You can also add a variety of features related to evolutionary population genetics and sex ratio equilibrium studies, such as different mortality rates for males and females, sexual selection by females.</p>
