        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This program is an example of a two-dimensional cellular automaton.  This particular cellular automaton is called The Game of Life.</p>
<p>A cellular automaton is a computational machine that performs actions based on certain rules.  It can be thought of as a board which is divided into cells (such as square cells of a checkerboard).  Each cell can be either "alive" or "dead."  This is called the "state" of the cell.  According to specified rules, each cell will be alive or dead at the next time step.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>The rules of the game are as follows.  Each cell checks the state of itself and its eight surrounding neighbors and then sets itself to either alive or dead.  If there are less than two alive neighbors, then the cell dies.  If there are more than three alive neighbors, the cell dies.  If there are 2 alive neighbors, the cell remains in the state it is in.  If there are exactly three alive neighbors, the cell becomes alive. This is done in parallel and continues forever.</p>
<p>There are certain recurring shapes in Life, for example, the "glider" and the "blinker". The glider is composed of 5 cells which form a small arrow-headed shape, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">   O
    O
  OOO
</code></pre>
<p>This glider will wiggle across the world, retaining its shape.  A blinker is a block of three cells (either up and down or left and right) that rotates between horizontal and vertical orientations.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>The INITIAL-DENSITY slider determines the initial density of cells that are alive.  SETUP-RANDOM places these cells.  GO-FOREVER runs the rule forever.  GO-ONCE runs the rule once.</p>
<p>If you want to draw your own pattern, use the DRAW-CELLS button and then use the mouse to "draw" and "erase" in the view.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>Find some objects that are alive, but motionless.</p>
<p>Is there a "critical density" - one at which all change and motion stops/eternal motion begins?</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>Are there any recurring shapes other than gliders and blinkers?</p>
<p>Build some objects that don't die (using DRAW-CELLS)</p>
<p>How much life can the board hold and still remain motionless and unchanging? (use DRAW-CELLS)</p>
<p>The glider gun is a large conglomeration of cells that repeatedly spits out gliders.  Find a "glider gun" (very, very difficult!).</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>Give some different rules to life and see what happens.</p>
<p>Experiment with using neighbors4 instead of neighbors (see below).</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>The neighbors primitive returns the agentset of the patches to the north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.  So <code>count neighbors with [living?]</code> counts how many of those eight patches have the <code>living?</code> patch variable set to true.</p>
<p><code>neighbors4</code> is like <code>neighbors</code> but only uses the patches to the north, south, east, and west.  Some cellular automata, like this one, are defined using the 8-neighbors rule, others the 4-neighbors.</p>
