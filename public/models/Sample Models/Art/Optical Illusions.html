        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This model presents seven optical illusions.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>The optical illusions are constructed using a combination of NetLogo turtles and patches.</p>
<h3>Illusion #1</h3>
<p>White circles on a gray background produce an illusion of the circles changing colors between black and white, depending on where you focus your eyes.</p>
<h3>Illusion #2</h3>
<p>Diagonals moving away from the center create an illusion of depth, which makes the parallel horizontal lines seem to bend in the center.</p>
<h3>Illusion #3</h3>
<p>The perpendicular lines that do not match row to row create an illusion of the lines between them being not parallel.</p>
<h3>Illusion #4</h3>
<p>Relative sizes of other circles skew the perception of the middle circles, creating an illusion of difference in size.</p>
<h3>Illusion #5</h3>
<p>Circles of diamonds seem to rotate as you focus your eyes on their center.</p>
<h3>Illusion #6</h3>
<p>Intensely saturated colors create an illusion of rippling waves of motion.</p>
<h3>Illusion #7</h3>
<p>Four simple concentric circles look like interlocking spirals.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Press a button to choose an illusion, and it will be presented in the NetLogo view.</p>
<p>Some explanatory text will appear in the monitor below the view.</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>Add more illusions.</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>Many of the illusions in the model, such as illusions 2, 4, 5 and 7, involve turtles positioned in a circle around a middle point.  This shows how to use <code>create-ordered-turtles</code>, <code>forward</code> and <code>heading</code> to position objects in a pattern.</p>
<h2>RELATED MODELS</h2>
<p>Other models that were created "for fun" include Frogger, Lunar Lander and other games included in the Games section of the Models Library.</p>
<h2>CREDITS AND REFERENCES</h2>
<p>Illusion #6 is based on the cover of the album "Merriweather Post Pavilion" by Animal Collective, which in turn is based on an illusion by Akiyoshi Kitaoka.</p>
