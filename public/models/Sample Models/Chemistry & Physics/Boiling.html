<p>This project depicts a simple cellular automata model that resembles a pot of boiling water. Heat is applied evenly to the entire pot, but when the temperature of a patch reaches the boiling temperature, the bubble pops and that patch's temperature drops to zero.</p>
<p>This process is analogous to the way in which a hot enough region of water gives up some heat by forming a bubble of steam. The water right around the steam bubble cools off for a moment.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>If all of a cell's neighbors are at the maximum value of 212, then that cell's new value will be 213 which gets wrapped down to zero. At the next tick, the presence of this zero-valued cell will lower the values of the cell's nearest neighbors.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Click the SETUP button to set up a random field of heat.</p>
<p>Click the BOIL button to start adding heat to the pot and watch it boil. The redder the color, the hotter the patch (Black is very cool and white is very hot).</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>Watch how the added heat diffuses through the pot. When bubbles pop, the resulting drop in heat affects nearby patches too by taking away their heat.</p>
<p>What happens to the average heat in the pot?</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>Try diffusing the heat more slowly through the system.</p>
<p>Change the diffuse parameter from 1 to a smaller fraction.</p>
<p>Add "ice cubes".</p>
<p>Add a heat sink, such as edges that constantly cool the liquid.</p>
