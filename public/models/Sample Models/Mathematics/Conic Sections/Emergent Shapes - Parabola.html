        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This model displays a conic section: the parabola. The ancient Greeks called circles, ellipses, hyperbolas and parabolas conic sections because they can be generated geometrically by taking different cross sections of a cone.  Later the conic sections were described algebraically as quadratic curves. In this model, the parabola shape is emergent, generated by the behavior of turtles that are trying to satisfy a distance criterion as below. There are two addtional models that demonstrate the use of an agent-based approach to exploring conic sections: Emergent Shapes - Ellipse, and Emergent Shapes - Hyperbola.</p>
<p>A parabola is the set of all points that are the same distance from a point (focus) and a line (directrix).</p>
<p>Here's an equivalent and less abstract description that may be easier to understand. Pick a point in the plane and call it the focus of the parabola. Choose a line and call it the directrix. Now pick any point in the plane and draw the line segment between that point and the focus. Draw the line segment from the point to the directrix that makes a right angle to the line. (This is the shortest such segment.)  Measure the length of each of these 2 line segments. If the lengths are then the point you chose is on the parabola. If not, then it isn't. The shape made by all the points for which the two distances are equal is the parabola.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>In this model the turtles use feedback to make decisions about how to behave. They set out in random directions and then act on information as to whether or not they are getting closer to where they want to be. If they are getting closer, they continue moving forward in the direction they are going. If they are moving farther away, they set out in a new random direction.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<h3>Create a Parabola</h3>
<p>Select the number of turtles with the NUM-TURTLES slider.
Press SETUP. A white circle (the focus) and a white line segment (the visible part of the directrix) will appear, as will green turtles in random locations.
Press the GO button. The turtles will move until they form a parabola.</p>
<h3>Change the Parabola</h3>
<p>You can move either the focus or the directrix by clicking on it and dragging it.</p>
<h3>The Distance Turtle</h3>
<p>A "distance turtle" is a randomly chosen turtle used to display the conic "distance." The distance turtle can only be visualized after both the focus and the directrix of the parabola have been chosen. The distance turtle has one red line segment connecting it
to the foci, and one red line segment connecting to the directrix at a right angle. Each segment is labeled with its length. The distance turtle will be on the
parabola when this difference is zero. The turtle is 'inside' the parabola if the
difference is positive, and 'outside' if it is negative.
If the location where distance turtle projects perpendicularly onto the directrix
is outside the world the corresponding red segment is hidden.</p>
<h4>The Monitor</h4>
<p>The monitor labeled "'conic distance' of distance turtle" shows the relevant values. An example would be "25.1 =
abs(-32.9) - 7.8". The perpendicular distance from the distance turtle to the
directrix is positive when the focus and distance turtle are on the same side of
the directrix, and negative when they are on opposite sides.</p>
<h4>New Distance Turtle Button</h4>
<p>Pressing the button activates a new distance turtle. If there is an existing distance turtle, it is replaced.</p>
<h4>Clear Distance Turtle Button</h4>
<p>If a distance turtle exists it will be deactivated and its red line segments will be removed.</p>
<h3>Refresh Turtles Button</h3>
<p>This button moves the small green turtles to random locations.
If there is a distance turtle it will persist.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>When forming a parabola turtles adjust their positions so that they are equidistant from the focus and the directrix. The distance from a point on the parabola to the directrix is measured along a line segment perpendicular to the directrix.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>You may be able to get a better feeling for the turtles’ behavior if only a few turtles are alive at a time. Try setting num-turtles to a small value (like 16 or 1) and watching the turtles.</p>
<p>Create  a distance turtle. Note the value of the lengths of the two red line segments. They are equal. Now click the "New Distance Turtle" button. Notice that the distance values have changed, but are still equal.</p>
<p>The constant conic-eps is set in the SETUP procedure. It determines how nearly  equidistant between the focus and the directrix the turtles have to be before they stop. Change its value — what do you see? Why? Be sure to try some integer values.</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>Add a switch which allows the parabola to wrap the screen instead of stopping at the screen edge.</p>
<p>Add a button that moves the focus by a fixed distance in a random direction.</p>
<p>Add a switch that makes the distance turtle or the segments that extend from it change color depending on whether the conic distance has increased, decreased or stayed the same after its most recent step.</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>The mouse primitives are used for handling interaction with the user.
Link commands are used to display distances from the distance turtle.
The ifelse-value primitive is used to set condition
dependent values.
The dx and dy primitives are used to give the amount by which the directrix's xcor and ycor would change) if the turtle were to take one step forward in its current heading.
The "carefully" primitive is used to avoid an error when
testing if ticks have been started.</p>
