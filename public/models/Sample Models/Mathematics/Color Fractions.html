        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>Color Fractions displays the decimal form of a fraction as a pattern of colors.  This lets you investigate how the resulting patterns relate to the original fraction.</p>
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>The program computes the digits of the decimal the same way you would do it using long division on paper.</p>
<p>It takes the numerator and divides it by the denominator; the result is a digit.  The remainder of the division, we multiply by 10 and take as the new numerator, then repeat.</p>
<p>For example these would be the steps for computing 1/7:</p>
<ul>
<li>7 goes into 1  0 times; 10 times remainder is 10</li>
<li>7 goes into 10 1 time ; 10 times remainder is 30</li>
<li>7 goes into 30 4 times; 10 times remainder is 20</li>
<li>7 goes into 20 2 times; 10 times remainder is 60</li>
<li>7 goes into 60 8 times; 10 times remainder is 40</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on forever.  Thus the result is 0.1428...</p>
<p>To make the pattern of colors, each digit, 0 through 9, is shown in its own color.  For example 0 is gray, 1 is light red, 2 is orange, etc.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Press the SETUP button, then press GO.</p>
<p>Now adjust the numerator and denominator sliders to make any fraction.</p>
<p>You can also use the WIDTH slider to change the total number of digits per row.  Changing the width can make patterns easier or harder to see.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>The same fraction always gives the same pattern.</p>
<p>Some patterns stop after a few digits, while others repeat forever.  (Do all fractions repeat?)</p>
<p>Do two fractions ever give the same pattern?</p>
<h2>THINGS TO TRY</h2>
<p>What kinds of patterns can you generate with fractions? Can you create a checkerboard?  Can you make vertical stripes?</p>
<p>What happens if you try different numerators with the same denominator?  What do the patterns you get have in common?  Try this experiment with several different denominators.</p>
<p>The "period" of a fraction is how many digits repeat to make the pattern.  For example, 1/3 is 0.33333... which repeats the same single digit over and over again, so the period is 1.  Look at the pattern for the fraction 1/7; the period is 6.  And so on.</p>
<p>How is the period of a fraction 1/n related to n?  How are the periods of the fractions family 1/7, 2/7, ... related?</p>
<p>How many fractions can you find that have the same number of repeating digits?</p>
<p>What fraction best approximates pi (3.141592...)?</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>Change the colors so odd numbers are all one color and even numbers are another color.</p>
<p>Change the colors so you only use one color, but vary the lightness/darkness.</p>
<p>Modify the program so you can visualize square roots and pi.</p>
<h2>NETLOGO FEATURES</h2>
<p>Patch labels are used to show the digits.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>sort</code> primitive to created a list of patches sorted left-to-right, top-to-bottom.  That is necessary in this model because we need the patches to execute in the same order at every tick, rather than a different random order every tick as would happen if we just said <code>ask patches</code>.</p>
