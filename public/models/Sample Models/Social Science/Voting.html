        <div class="model-info"><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>This model is a simple cellular automaton that simulates voting distribution by having each patch take a "vote" of its eight surrounding neighbors, then perhaps change its own vote according to the outcome.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2>
<p>Click the SETUP button to create an approximately equal but random distribution of blue and green patches.  Click GO to run the simulation.</p>
<p>When both switches are off, the central patch changes its color to match the majority vote, but if there is a 4-4 tie, then it does not change.</p>
<p>If the CHANGE-VOTE-IF-TIED? switch is on, then in the case of a tie, the central patch will always change its vote.</p>
<p>If the AWARD-CLOSE-CALLS-TO-LOSER? switch is on, then if the result is 5-3, the central patch votes with the losing side instead of the winning side.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>
<p>Watch how any setup quickly settles to a static state when both switches are off.</p>
<p>Watch what happens when only the CHANGE-VOTE-IF-TIED? switch is on.  How is the result different?</p>
<p>Watch what happens when only the AWARD-CLOSE-CALLS-TO-LOSER? switch is on.  How is the result different?</p>
<p>What happens when both switches are on?</p>
<h2>EXTENDING THE MODEL</h2>
<p>Try other voting rules.</p>
<p>Start with a nonrandom green-and-blue pattern. For example, one could make half of the world blue and half green.</p>
<p>Can you enhance the model to incorporate multiple colors and multiple votes?  One might interpret shades of color to represent the degree of a patch's opinion about an issue: strongly against, against, neutral, etc.  Each patch could have more than two choices and weighted votes: blue patches' vote could count twice, etc.</p>
